## Features:

 1. When I search for a city, I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.

 2. I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.

 3. When I view the UV index, I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.

 3. When I view future weather conditions for that city, I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.

 4. When I click on city in the search history, I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
